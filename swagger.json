    "description" : "Product definition management shall be defined as the collection of activities that manage all of the Level 3 information about the product required for manufacturing, including the product production rules. Product definition information is shared between product production rules, bill of material and bill of resources. The product production rules contain the information used to instruct a manufacturing operation how to produce a product. This may be called a work master (ISA-95 Part 4), general, site, or master recipe (ANSI/ISA-88.00.01 and IEC 61512-1 definitions), standard operating procedure (SOP), standard operating conditions (SOC), routing, or assembly steps based on the production strategy used. The product definition information is made available to other Level 3 functions and to Level 2 functions as required. Product definition management includes management of the distribution of product production rules. Some of the product production rules may exist in Level 2 and Level 1 equipment. When that is the case, downloads of this information shall be coordinated with other manufacturing operations management functions to avoid affecting production. This information may be included as part of operational commands when the download is part of a production execution management activity.",
